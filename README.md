Creating Database
Before you can run your code or create your tables, you'll need to use the create database command in psql to create the database. 
Use the name tournament for your database.

Then you can connect psql to your new database and create your tables from the statements you've written in tournament.sql. 
You can do this in either of two ways:

Paste each statement in to psql.
Use the command \i tournament.sql to import the whole file into psql at once.

Running project!

To run the series of tests defined in this test suite, run the program from the command line $ python tournament_test.py
